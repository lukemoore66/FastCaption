# FastCaption
An image captioning GUI written in PowerShell

PowerShell v7 required

This script will generate a GUI that will allow the fast editing of captions via a preset system.
It will also display thumbnails of each image, so they can be browsed and edited very fast.
The captions are stored in a matching text file, tha shares the same name as the image.
This is useful for captioning images for text-to-image projects like Stable Diffusion
